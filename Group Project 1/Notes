Datasets used:
- Inc5000 US Fastest Growing Companies 2007-2017
- Inc5000 US Fastest Growing Companies 2018
- Inc5000 Europe Fastest Growing Companies 2016
- Inc5000 Europe Fastest Growing Companies 2017
- Inc5000 Europe Fastest Growing Companies 2018

 Data Cleansing:
- Find blanks in each csv and determine if rows are needed
- Blank idustry fields - research companies and determine correct industry
- Standardize the column names across all csvs
- Drop unwanted columns 
- Concact the csvs into a single US DatFrame and a single European DataFrame


 Visualizations:
1. What correlation does growth have to revenue?
	- Scatter plot of revenue vs growth to see how spread European companies are in terms of growth and current revenue
	- Scatter plot of revenue vs growth to see how spread United States companies are in terms of growth and current revenue
		- These graphs show the spread of revenue totals and their accompanying growth rates per company. The main insight 
		  how European companies that made this list had a higher probability and chance of having both moderately high
		  revenue as well as a realatively high growth percentage year over year
		  
	- Strip plot scatter plot of the growth per industry: United States 
	- Strip plot scatter plot of the growth per industry: Europe
		- These graphs showed the revenue totals per company per industry. They helped visualize outliers within an industry.
		  The insight for these graphs was pointing out the giant outliers in both datasets. Health in the US had a large outlier
		  (HCA) and Europe had a large financial industry company. 
		  In general, in Europe, the companies had more spread in the level of revenue that across all industries. 
	
2. Are fastest growing companies relatively concentrated in certain areas?
	- Heat map that shows where the greatest number of companies are located that appear in the top 5000 over the course
	of 11 years (2007-2018)
		- The greatest concentration of companies were displayed to be in NY, TX, FL, CA with smaller but stll significant 
		concentrations around Chicago, and Atlanta. In general however, the Midwest was well representated contrary to 
		our preconceptions. 
		
3. What industries are doing better(revenue) in United States than Europe?
	- Double bar graph that compares key industries' revenue over the course of 2016-2018
		- This graph was really telling how the US compares to Europe across various industries. Health, Energy, and
		retail really stuck out. Europe was in general out performed by the US across the board but were behind in key areas.
